	"is_it_pet_safe": "This product is not safe for pets like dogs and cats. Mango can cause digestive upset and some dogs are allergic to it. It is unclear what 'nature-identical flavouring substances (mango)' are and could pose a risk.",
	"regulations": "While the product lists 'no added preservative', it does contain an antioxidant (INS 300) which acts as a preservative. This is a common practice and not concerning in itself. The product also lists food color (INS 110) which is likely Tartrazine. Tartrazine is an artificial food coloring and a known allergen that some individuals may react to. There have also been concerns about Tartrazine potentially contributing to hyperactivity in some children."
